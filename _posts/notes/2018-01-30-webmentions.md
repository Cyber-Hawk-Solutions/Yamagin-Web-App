# Webmentions are weird

I'm not going to lie; I love the concept of webmentions but there is way too much complication around their use, set up and adoption. Even simply things like finding a tool online to test my implementation took way longer than it should've. I'm surprised that it got to point of being a W3C recommendation.

I'd love to see a big player push but they'd have to be more altruistic than any large company is likely to be.

Even cool ideas like micro.blog that make it easier to get started still suffer from things like subscriptions, discoverability and the odd choice of including a timeline.

I'm done with timelines. I'm bored of clever algorithms. I'm sick of engagement. I just want the web to be weird again.
